I am a Software Engineer student at European University of Lefka
This project will be mine master (finish) project for my academic education
Program will be detect automatically [English] words with natural language and create a web site what's users want.
I didn't decide the which programming language is better for this so it's not started yet.
I added just a single intro page to how program works like in python

1-) Run python code in terminal
2-) Start speaking.
2.1-) If saying creator creator is activate itself and create a page (html file your own directory)
2.2-) If saying designer, designer is activate itself and adding h2 tags or div.
3-) Program ends
